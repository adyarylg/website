What is the difference between a Senior Stylist and a Hair Expert?
Our stylists are categorized based on experience and advanced training. A Senior Stylist has extensive experience in classic and modern cuts, while a Hair Expert has specialized training in creative cutting, advanced colouring techniques, and complex hair transformations.

How do I maintain my hair colour after leaving the salon?
We recommend using professional, sulphate-free shampoos and conditioners designed for colour-treated hair. Avoid over-washing and use a heat protectant spray before styling. Regular glossing treatments at the salon can also refresh your colour's vibrancy between appointments.
