The YLG Difference: A Guide to Brazilian & Bikini Waxing
For many, intimate waxing can be daunting. At YLG Adyar, we make it a comfortable, professional, and empowering experience. Our B-Wax system is a breakthrough in intimate hair removal, designed specifically for sensitive areas.

What is B-Wax?
Our B-Wax is a premium, cream-based stripless wax. Its low melting point ensures it's warm and soothing, never hot. The quick-dry formula is removed gently without the need for cloth strips, pulling hair cleanly from the root with minimal discomfort. Infused with brightening serums, it even helps reduce dark patches, making it the ideal choice for a flawless Brazilian or bikini wax.

Our Commitment to Hygiene
Your safety is our priority. For all intimate waxing, our therapists use single-use disposable spatulas, surgical gloves, and face masks. There is absolutely no 'double-dipping', guaranteeing the highest standard of hygiene and preventing any risk of infection.
