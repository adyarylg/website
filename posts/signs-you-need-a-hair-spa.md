Is your hair feeling dry, frizzy, and lifeless? It might be crying out for a professional hair spa treatment. At YLG Adyar, we see many clients who struggle with hair damage without realizing that a simple, relaxing solution is available. Here are five key signs that it’s time to book a hair spa appointment.

### 1. Your Hair is Constantly Dry and Brittle
If your hair feels like straw and snaps easily, it lacks moisture. Environmental factors, heat styling, and chemical treatments can strip your hair of its natural oils. A deep-conditioning hair spa replenishes this lost moisture, leaving your hair soft and supple.

### 2. You Have Uncontrollable Frizz
Frizz is a classic sign of a raised hair cuticle, which happens when hair is dry and damaged. Our hair spa treatments, featuring products from L'Oréal Professionnel, smooth down the cuticle, taming frizz and leaving your hair sleek and manageable.

### 3. Your Scalp is Itchy or Flaky
A healthy scalp is the foundation of healthy hair. If you're experiencing dandruff, itchiness, or excessive oiliness, a hair spa can help. We start with a gentle scalp massage to improve circulation, followed by a targeted treatment to cleanse and balance your scalp.

### 4. Your Hair Lacks Shine and Looks Dull
Pollution and product buildup can coat the hair shaft, making it look dull and lifeless. A professional hair spa treatment deeply cleanses your hair, removing impurities and restoring its natural shine and vibrancy.

### 5. You're Experiencing Hair Fall
While some hair fall is normal, excessive shedding can be a sign of weak hair roots and follicles. The nourishing ingredients in our hair spa treatments strengthen the hair from the root, reducing breakage and promoting healthier growth.

### What to Expect During Your Hair Spa at YLG Adyar
Our hair spa is a multi-step process designed for relaxation and results. It typically includes a gentle shampoo, application of a nutrient-rich mask, a relaxing head massage, steam therapy to help the mask penetrate deeply, and a final rinse and conditioning. You'll leave not only with beautiful hair but also feeling completely refreshed.
