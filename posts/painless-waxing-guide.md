The very mention of waxing can make some people cringe, but it doesn’t have to be that way. At YLG Adyar, we’ve perfected the art of "painless waxing" with our signature Waxing 2.0 system. Here are answers to some of the most common questions we get.

### What makes YLG waxing "painless"?
Our secret lies in two things: our wax and our technique. We use a scientifically formulated wax that is designed to grip the hair, not the skin. This dramatically reduces the pulling sensation on your skin, which is the primary source of pain. Combined with our expert therapists' swift and gentle technique, the experience is surprisingly comfortable.

### Is it really 100% painless?
While "painless" is the goal, sensitivity varies from person to person. Most of our clients report a significant reduction in pain compared to traditional waxing, often describing it as a slight, momentary sting rather than a prolonged, painful pull. It is especially effective for sensitive areas like the bikini line.

### What is a "hygienic, single-use cartridge"?
Unlike salons that "double-dip" spatulas into a communal pot of wax, we use a completely sealed, single-use cartridge for each client. The wax is rolled on, ensuring a fresh, clean application every time. This eliminates any risk of cross-contamination and is the highest standard of hygiene in the industry.

### What about pre- and post-waxing care?
Proper care is crucial for the best results. Before your appointment, gently exfoliate the area and ensure your hair is about a quarter-inch long. After your wax, avoid hot baths, tight clothing, and direct sun for 24-48 hours. Moisturize daily to keep your skin smooth and prevent ingrown hairs.
