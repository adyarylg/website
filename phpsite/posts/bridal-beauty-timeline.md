Every bride wants to glow on her wedding day. But that perfect bridal radiance doesn’t happen overnight! It requires a well-planned skincare regimen leading up to the big day. Here is our recommended timeline for achieving flawless, wedding-ready skin.

### 6 Months Before: Consultation & Core Routine
This is the time to visit us for a detailed skin consultation. We’ll assess your skin type and concerns and recommend a home-care routine. If you have specific issues like acne or pigmentation, starting treatments now gives your skin ample time to respond and heal.

### 3 Months Before: Advanced Treatments
Now is the time to start a series of facials. We recommend our **European Light Therapy Facials**, scheduled once a month. This advanced treatment boosts collagen, evens out skin tone, and gives you a deep, lasting glow. Consistency is key here.

### 1 Month Before: Final Touches
Get your final facial about two weeks before the wedding. This allows any redness to subside while ensuring your skin is at its peak. This is also a good time for a full-body de-tan or polishing treatment so you glow from head to toe.

### The Week Of: Relax and Hydrate
Avoid trying any new products or treatments this week. Focus on hydration—drink plenty of water and use a hydrating face mask. Get your final, "painless" waxing done 2-3 days before the main events to ensure your skin is smooth but not irritated. And most importantly, get plenty of sleep!
