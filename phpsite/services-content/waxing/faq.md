Your Waxing Questions, Answered
Is a Brazilian wax at YLG Adyar truly painless?
While sensitivity varies, our clients consistently report a significant reduction in pain compared to traditional methods. Our unique wax formulation and expert techniques are designed to minimize discomfort, making it as close to painless as possible.

How long should my hair be for waxing?
For the best results, we recommend your hair be at least 1/4 inch long (about the length of a grain of rice). This allows the wax to get a firm grip on the hair for clean removal.

What is the difference between a Bikini Line and a Full Bikini (Brazilian) wax?
A Bikini Line wax removes the hair from the areas visible around a standard bikini bottom. A Full Bikini, or Brazilian, wax removes all the hair from the front to the back, including the intimate areas, often leaving a small strip or triangle at the front if desired.

How can I prevent ingrown hairs after waxing?
The key is exfoliation and hydration. Gently exfoliate the area 2-3 times a week starting 48 hours after your appointment, and moisturize daily. This helps keep the skin smooth and allows new hair to grow out freely.
