Everyone complimented my haircut and I feel so confident now! Thank You! The service was highly professional. Even after hairwash the layers a well maintained. Will surely visit again \ud83e\udd70\n\nService 1: My go to salon is YLG! Since 2019. Visited this outlet recently and the ambiance was just bright and amazing. Took hair spa as they had some good offer. The service was handled by Shakunthala who looked experienced and so kind. I was so comfortable while having the hairspa and head massage she did was quite calming. Also, I regularly trim my eyebrows here. Services are too good!",

I took the following services - Absolute Repair Molecular Hair Spa (To fix my frizzy, weak hair with breakage), along with Bombini Pedicure and Japanese Blanch Facial. Staffs there suggested treatments based on my skin and hair type without any pressure to choose additional services. They are very professional with good knowledge in whatever service they do & thoroughly explained each process, which I really appreciate. Also their warm and welcoming hospitality made the experience even better! I highly recommend YLG\u2014because at YLG \u201c You look great ! \u201c",
